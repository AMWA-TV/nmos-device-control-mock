# Style Guide

## Overall Style

- The guide should be as terse as possible.
- The guide should not contain normative language.
- The guide should read like a recipe for how to implement the specification.
- Assume the reader is approaching from the angle of “I have a broadcast device/controller and now want to make it support NMOS”.
- Give examples.
- Identify gotchas.

## References

- The guide should not simply repeat the specification.
- The guide can reference widely available resources to aid implementation (for instance nmos-cpp).
- Do not cut and paste from other sources; provide a reference instead.
- Do not regurgitate or attempt to paraphrase any passages from the AMWA specifications; reference the relevant passages instead.
