## Introduction

Write the Implementation Guide using (GitHub Flavoured) Markdown documents.

Put diagrams (ideally PNG with encapsulated draw.io source) in the `images/` sub-directory.

Follow the [Style Guide](Style%20Guide.md).

Make a bulleted list of documents in `README.md` in this directory.

Set the repo name used to get the Lint and Render status in the top-level `README.md` (four changes needed).

Set the value of `amwa_id` in `.render/_config.yml` to the AMWA-assigned ID.
